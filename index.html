                    <p>In the heart of Neurobis, the most advanced city in the world, where everything ran on smart energy, lived three teenagers: Adam, Salim, and Laila.
The city was lit day and night, robots served people, cars drove themselves on the roads, and houses opened and closed by voice commands. It seemed as if humans had become guests in their own homes.

                    <h2>Chapter Two: The First Lesson About Space Weather</h2>
                    <p>Days passed, and Laila was invited to attend a scientific workshop at the city’s space center.
There, she learned for the first time the meaning of space weather: a group of phenomena caused by the changes in the sun and its effect on Earth.
The lead scientist explained:
– “The sun is not just a burning ball, but an energy factory. Sometimes it explodes in massive bursts called Solar Flares. These flares release high-energy particles that can reach Earth, affecting satellites, disturbing navigation systems, and may even cause power outages.”
Laila raised her hand and asked: “Could this actually happen to our city?”
The scientist smiled: “Of course, and it happened in the past. In 1859, the Carrington Solar Storm caused telegraph wires to catch fire. If this happens again today, our entire digital world could collapse.”
Laila returned to tell Adam and Salim what she had heard.
Adam’s eyes widened in surprise: “So we might wake up one day and find our city in darkness?”
Salim laughed sarcastically: “And what will we do then? Read books?”
Laila smiled mischievously: “Maybe yes. Books don’t go out.”

                    <h2>Chapter Three: The Coming Storm</h2>
                    <p>Two years passed.
The three grew a little, but their curiosity didn’t fade. Adam became more attached to the sky, Salim became more creative in fixing old devices, and Laila fell more in love with science.
One clear night, while they were on the roof of an abandoned building, strange colors appeared in the sky: green and purple streaks dancing on the horizon.
Laila shouted: “It’s the aurora borealis!”
Adam answered worriedly: “But how? We’re not in the polar regions.”
Silence fell between them, then Salim said softly: “Could this be the beginning of a solar storm?”
The next day, the first signs began: the internet slowed down, navigation devices malfunctioned, and phone signals were cut off.
By nightfall… the entire city went dark.

                    <p>For the first time in decades, Neurobis was plunged into darkness. Hospitals stopped, robots fell in the streets, cars stumbled, and people got lost.
Children cried, and adults shouted… while the three sat in an apartment lit only by the wick of a candle.
Salim said:
“I can’t believe everything ended… with just a touch from the sun.”
Laila replied:
“It’s not over… it’s just beginning.”
Adam added quietly:
“This is a test. Not for technology, but for us.”

                    <h2>Chapter Five: A Journey Through Old Books</h2>
                    <p>They decided to search for solutions.
They remembered an old library on the city’s outskirts that no one visited anymore.
They reached it after a long walk through dark streets. Dust covered the shelves, and the books were almost neglected.
They began searching through scientific and historical books until they found a volume about “space weather.”
They read that solar storms could paralyze civilizations if they were unprepared.
They also found stories about how humans long ago relied on the stars and compass to find their way and how they built civilizations without electricity.
Laila said: “The past hides solutions. We must relearn them.”
Adam: “We need a safe place, far from the city’s chaos.”
Salim: “But can we live without electricity?”
Adam smiled: “We’ll make primitive electricity ourselves.”

                    <p>While browsing through an old radio device, Salim picked up a strange encrypted signal.
Laila succeeded in decoding it… and it was a message from a secret space launch station.
Its name: “New Exodus 12” – an old project to transfer humans to an alternative planet called “Super Earth” or “Nova Terra.”
The station was underground, in a distant mountainous area, and was still partially operational.
The three decided to head there, using star maps drawn by Adam.
But they were not alone…
Another team led by Dr. Verso wanted to control the ship and monopolize it for an elite group of scientists only.
The three faced this idea with determination.
Laila proved that knowledge is not exclusive to anyone.
Salim restarted the main propulsion system.
Adam guided them through the darkness to the launch platform.
And at the last moment…
Horizon 9 launched toward the stars.

A sky that changes colors.
Pure air.
Unknown terrains.
They built a base called “Dawn 1.”
Adam led the sky observation team,
Laila began planting seeds from Earth,
Salim created a primitive communication network called “Nova Voice.”
They started from nothing… but they were ready.

Children began learning from books and the sky.
Adults learned how to live with the new nature.
Adam became the leader of the exploration team,
Laila established a science laboratory,
Salim made the first primitive computer on the planet.
One night, a strange flash appeared in the sky…
Laila said:
“It’s as if the planet… is greeting us back.”
